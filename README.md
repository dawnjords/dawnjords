# Hi, I'm Jordan 👋  
### Full-stack dev in the making | React addict | AI tinkerer | Docker survivor

I'm currently completing a full-stack development program where I've been building real-world applications across web, mobile, cloud, and AI.  

## What I'm Working On
- Building full-stack applications with **React**, **Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB**
- Creating mobile experiences with **React Native**
- Integrating cloud AI services like **Azure Custom Vision** and **Google Gemini**
- Strengthening my DevOps workflow with **Docker**, **CI/CD**, and container-based development (and occasionally negotiating with containers that refuse to behave)

## Tech Stack & Tools
**Frontend:**  
React • React Native • JavaScript • HTML • CSS • Tailwind • Figma  

**Backend:**  
Node.js • Express • MongoDB • Mongoose • REST APIs  

**Cloud & DevOps:**  
Azure AI Services • Docker • Git/GitHub • CI/CD • Postman  

**Other Interests:**  
Prompt engineering • Debugging (eventually) • Good folder structure • Clean UI  

## Featured Projects
A few of the projects I've built during my developer journey:

### Z Energy Web and Mobile App  
Full-stack solution with onboarding screens, authentication, component-based UX, and a Dockerized backend.  
*Tech:* React, Express, Node.js, MongoDB, Docker, REST APIs  

### AI Insurance Consultant (“Tina”)  
An AI-powered chatbot that asks dynamic questions and recommends insurance products.  
*Tech:* Google Gemini API, Node.js, JSON-formatted responses  

### Turners Car Image Classifier  
Cloud-based application that identifies vehicle types from images using Azure Custom Vision.  
*Tech:* React, Node.js, Azure AI, environment variables  
(I trained it to recognise cars… it recognised my cat once. We’re working on it.)

## Currently Learning
- More advanced React patterns  
- Authentication and security best practices  
- Improving mobile UX and animations  
- Making my Docker containers behave (one day they will respect me)

## What I Bring
- A customer-centric mindset from years in customer service and banking  
- A genuine love for solving problems - especially the ones that make me question my life choices before the breakthrough  
- Strong communication & teamwork  
- The ability to learn fast and stay calm in the chaos  
- Persistence (if something breaks, I *will* fix it, even if it means Googling at 1am)
